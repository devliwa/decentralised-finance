- **Ownership:** Users control their data and digital assets via **crypto wallets** (e.g., MetaMask).  
- **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing agreements that remove intermediaries.  
- **Cryptocurrencies & Tokens:** Used for payments, governance, or rewards.  
- **Identity:** **Decentralized identities (DIDs)** replace logins like Google or Facebook.
