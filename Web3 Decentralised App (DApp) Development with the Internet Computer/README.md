# 📘 Read Me!

Hey 👋

Just a quick word of advice before diving in!

A lot of you are eager to learn the latest technologies and start developing for **Web3** — and that’s awesome! 🚀  
But it’s important to understand that these materials are placed **at the end of this Web Development course for a reason**:  
👉 They’re **more advanced** and require a solid foundation.

---

## ⚙️ Before You Begin

In the upcoming modules, I’ll assume that you have already completed the previous parts of the course and that you’re comfortable with:

- **React**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (JS)**
- **Building front-end and back-end applications**

If you’ve skipped ahead directly to the Web3 section, you might find it **challenging** — unless you already have web development experience.

So, if anything feels confusing, **pause** and go back to complete the earlier sections first.  
You’ll find the advanced topics much easier once your fundamentals are strong.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

I love learning the newest tech too — but remember:  
> “Strong foundations build strong developers.”

Take your time, enjoy the process, and keep building! 💪

All the best,
